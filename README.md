# LAB08-LINQ

Author: Deziree Teague 

Read in a JSON file that contains a data set of location information for properties in Manhattan. Use LINQ queries and Lambda statements to output the following in the console: all of the neighborhoods in this data list, filter out all the neighborhoods that do not have any names, remove the Duplicates, then consolodate all into a single query.

## Usage:

* Create JObjects using data from the LINQ.json file
* Create neighborhood list
* Filter the list and print results

## Output Examples:

![all hoods](https://github.com/dezteague/LAB08-LINQ/blob/master/Assets/allneighborhoods.JPG)
![distinct names](https://github.com/dezteague/LAB08-LINQ/blob/master/Assets/onlyhoodswithnames.JPG)
![remove dupes](https://github.com/dezteague/LAB08-LINQ/blob/master/Assets/removeduplicates.JPG)
